- Only probably about 8 views but will show different blocks depending on who the “current user” is
- We cannot move forward much yet because a lot of the material has not yet been taught in class but we can still do wireframes and start outlining how the site will look
- We should probably pair the beginning of the project so everyone has an understanding
- Noah posted a link to database schema used last inning.  Recommends everyone take a look at it while going through the user stories and see if anything is missing or can be changed.
